\section{Hand Plot}

To plot a two-dimensional function by hand one must take the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the domain of the function.
    \item Determine the intersection points of the function with the $x$
          and $y$ axes.
    \item Find asymptotes, if any.
    \item Analyze the slope of the function on the domain.
    \item Analyze the concavity of the function on the domain.
    \item Construct a unified table providing all relavent information in a
          convenient way.
    \item Graph points of intrests and plot the table accordingly.
\end{enumerate}
