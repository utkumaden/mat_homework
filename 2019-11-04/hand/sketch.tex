\subsection{Sketch}

For the final step, I will supply my hand-drawn sketch (per the assignment
requirements.)
The image is scaled 40\% to fit on the page.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=118.8mm, height=84mm]{hand/scan.png}
\end{center}

For making it easier to compare my plot to the realistic plot, I have
vectorized the image. (Notice how the hand plot has inaccuracies around 
inflection and extremum points.)
