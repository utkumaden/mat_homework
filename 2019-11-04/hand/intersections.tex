\subsection{Intersections}

To find where the function intersects the $y$ axis you must simply
find the value of the function at \(x = 0\).

\[
    \begin{aligned}
        x = 0 & \\
        x^2\cdot e^x & = (0)^2 \cdot e^0 \\
        & = 0\cdot 1 \\
        & = 0 \\
    \end{aligned}
\]

Hence \((0,0)\) is an intersection point of the function.

To find the points the function intersects the $x$ axis one must find the values
of $x$ where $y = 0$. Since the product will be zero if any operand is zero,
one can evaulate the operands of the multiplication separately.

\[
    \begin{aligned}
        x^2 & = 0 \\
        x & \in \left\{0\right\}
    \end{aligned}
\]

\[
    e^x = 0 \text{ has no solution.}
\]

Therefore the only point this function intersects any axes is the origin \((0,0)\).
