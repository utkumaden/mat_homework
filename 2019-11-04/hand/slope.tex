\subsection{Slope}

Finding the slope of the function is another integral part of
plotting a function. First, one must derive the function.

\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{d(x^2\cdot e^x)}{dx} &
          = (2x)(e^x) + (x^2)(e^x) \\
        & = (e^x)(x^2 + 2x) \\
        & = x(e^x)(x+2)
    \end{aligned}
\]

Now we will evaluate the slope with the given derivative.

\[
    \begin{split}
        f'(x) = 0 = x(e^x)(x+2) = 0 \\
        x \in \left\{0, -2\right\}
    \end{split}
\]

So the slope of the function is as so:

\[
    - \infty \xrightarrow{\text{increasing}} -2 \xrightarrow[\text{decreasing}]{} 0 \xrightarrow{\text{increasing}} +\infty
\]

We can also see that $-2$ is a local maximum and $0$ is a local minimum.
